# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data
## Kickstarting with Excel
### Overview of Project
---This project was to provide Louise an analysis on the likely success of raising funds and opening her play "Fever".---We further dive into comparison of other successful project launches based on fundrasing goal and launch date.This will allow    Louise to assess the best time and target goal for her play to be the most successful
### Analysis and Challenges
#### Analysis
---Information is gathered with criteria based on historical data that is filtered around launch date and fundrasing goals of theater plays.---In addition to the data some visual representation of the data comparing the Theater Outcomes vs. Launch as show in ![Theater   Outcomes vs. Launch](https://github.com/jobloom79/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.PNG) and ![Outcomes   vs. Goals](https://github.com/jobloom79/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.PNG)
#### Challenges
---Some challenges are making sure the data is clean and properly being analyzed with mathmatical computation.
---When glossing over some of the information, I had to go back and redo some inputs to prevent corrupt data causing incorrect outputs. I had to look up some how to's on some of the mathmatical formulas like the COUNTIFS() function.
#### Findings
---The Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Datd findings provided results of a significant increase in the number of theater launches in May and it starts to decline an average of 10 openings each month to a low in December.
---Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals section shows the success rate is highest at the smaller goals less than 1000 and steadly declines to the lowes in 25000-29999 range. There is a spike in the 35000-39000 range and it dips back down after 40000.
### Results
---Two conclusions that can be drawn from the outcomes based on launch date is the best month to launch is in May, and the number of successes vs fail are even in the Month of December.
---For the Outcomes based on Goals we see there is more of a likely to have more successful fundraising goals under $5000 and anything over $25000 will significantly increase the failure rate, while decreasing the number of participants.
#### Summary
---One main limitation found is the data gives two different comparisons that are not necessarily correlated. There should be a better visual comparision as opposed to having two independent views of the dataset
---A possible soluction is to have outcomes based on goal showing number of successful and failed to match the count from the outcomes based on launch. Also maybe using a histogram to show 3 data sets to include the Goal amount, filter success/failed/canceled and show the launch date by month
